Hi, everyone. I am a freshman attending Chung-Ang University College of Arts and Engineering. This site was created for a project by Professor BoA, who has done a lot of research in Art & Technology, in the Applied Arts Engineering class. Our team has been considering various things as the saying, "Let's digitize everything." Among them, we picked one theme from the KPOP!
